# Dictionary
A dictionary, sometimes known as a wordbook, is a collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically, which may include information on definitions, synonyms, pronunciations, translation, etc. or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon. It is a lexicographical product which shows inter-relationships among the data. We chose Dictionary to implement Data Structure algorithms. After making Dictionary we are now able to understand the concepts of Data Structure. We made this project because Dictionary is the need of almost every student .We used Binary Search Tree Data Structure in our project because we needed efficient searching as well as insertion. BST take at least O(log2 n) time complexity to find and insert a particular node.
